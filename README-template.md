# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### Ovreview

Really proud to have finished this challenge. 
This has been my first challenge using JavaScript, and at the beginnig it was a little bit tough with the accordion and right positioning of the HTML tags and classes. Probably I made some little mistake in the js code or I colud have done it a little bit clear and clena (and shorte. 
It was really challenging and I improved my knowledge with events and the DOM.

For the CSS section I didn't have any particular issues, I think that the code is pretty clear.

## My process

1) Started from the HTML code, trying to put the accordion_question and accordion_content in the best way possibile. I've changed them several times before finding the right solutions.
2) Then the styling in CSS starting with the mobile version first.
3) Added some ':hover' effects and CSS animations to make it look like smoother (the arrow icons)
4) Used @media query to make desk version.
5) Finally, I switched to JavaScript to make the accordions works fine.


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Event Handler


### What I learned

I learned a lot from this challenge. Never used JavaScript before for a project like this. 

I guess I've:

- Improved my knowledge with the array methods;
- If statement using the DOM;
- How to make an accordion;
- Add events and make the webpage interactive;


### Continued development

Keep going through JavaScript, I've just started to work with it and I wolud love to know it deeper.
